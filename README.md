# CytoCaricature:

**CytoCaricature** is a passion project of mine initially made to assist in my fairly specific needs within my research. It deals specifically with cell analysis but can apply to other images if needed. 

## Get Started:

The usable (not-yet-stable-the-code-is-messy) binaries can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/jeffock/cyto_caricature/releases) with brief descriptions of functionality and the specific release itself.
