v2.1.0 WIP

---

### CytoCaricature:
**CytoCaricature** is a passion project of mine initially made to assist in my fairly specific needs within my research. It deals specifically with cell analysis but can apply to other images if needed. 

### Get Started:
The usable (not-yet-stable-the-code-is-messy) binaries can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/jeffock/cyto_caricature/releases) with brief descriptions of functionality and the specific release itself.
These binaries were built for Windows 64-bit. Support for 32-bit (or just x86), Linux, MacOS, and ARM may come in future versions.

### Dependencies/Libraries:
- glad:x64-windows v0.1.36
- glfw3:x64-windows v3.4#1
- imgui:x64-windows v1.91.9
- opencv:x64-windows v5.29.3
